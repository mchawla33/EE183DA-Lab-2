        	<h3>Objective:</h3>
          <pre>
            The purpose of the project was to develop a robot that could play music. My initial 
            thought process was to model it off of an already existing instrument. In order to keep things
            simple, I chose to model it off a drumstick and a pair of drums. This did not mean an actual 
            drum set, but rather a long cylindrical object could hit something that would make noise. This 
            was my mindset for developing this robot.

          <h3>Materials:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>ESP8266 microcontroller</li>
            <li>NodeMCU motor shield</li>
            <li>FEETECH FS90R servo</li>
            <li>“Drumstick” (I used a plastic knife)</li>
            <li>“Drums” (I used two cups)</li>
            <li>Tape</li>
            <li>Small square of cardboard</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Development:</h3>
          <pre>
          The first part of the process was to get the motor working. I connected the microcontroller to the
          motor shield. These two parts are made to be compatible and they just slipped right into each other.
          Next, the servo was connected. I chose to use a servo which allowed me to set the exact angle of the
          motor. This would allow me to mimic the motion of a drummer changing the angle of his or her
          drumstick in order to strike the drum. If I had a control over the angle, I could change the
          angles at varying speeds to repeatedly hit my “drum”. Therefore, I chose this servo over a
          continuous servo. The servo was connected to the GPIO pins of the motor shield,which are mapped
          to the IO pins of the microcontroller. 

          The next step in the development was software based. I decided to use the Servo arduino library. This
          library gave a simple interface and allowed me to set precise angles. As per the documentation for
          the library, the attach() function was used to map the ESP8266 pin to the servo. The
          writeMicroseconds() function could be used to set the angle. At this point, I used a circular
          attachment to create a rotating base on the motor. Using tape, I fixed my “drumstick” onto the
          motor. For the “drumstick”, I used a plastic knife. It has a straight shape and a hard exterior
          like a drumstick, yet it was light enough to not provide too much strain on the tiny motor.
          After some experimentation, I found that a range of 1200 to 2000, used as input to
          writeMicroseconds(), would give me a good range of motion to strike an object with enough
          force to produce sound. I used a glass cup as my “drum.” At this point, the robot could hit a
          cup at varying speeds to produce music.

          My next phase of development was to add more sounds. By observation, I could see that the “drumstick”
          had enough range of motion to be able to hit another “drum” on its backswing. Therefore, I added
          another “drum” and changed the resting position of the “drumstick” to be a midpoint between them
          (1500 input). Now, the robot could create two different pitches, in varying patterns, and at
          varying speeds. In order to program the patterns, I created an array of 1’s and 0’s in the code.
          This array would then be passed to a loop that would iterate through it. A 0 would correspond to
          one pitch, and a 1 to another pitch. With this system, changing the pattern of 1’s and 0’s in
          the array would effectively change the “song” the robot was playing. At this point, the robot
          was able to autonomously generate music.

          The final step in development was to be able to add an element of human control. I decided to go with
          preprogrammed songs. The microcontroller contains a WiFi server, which could be used to control the
          device. The code was set up so that the device could read in the request via the URL of the page.
          The URL was formatted as such: http://IP_address/command The command would vary based on the
          instructions sent to the device. I created an HTML page with several buttons, which could change
          the command portion of the URL. Each of the commands would change two parameters in the code: The
          array which held the pattern of pitches to hit, and the timing parameter. Therefore, a user
          could click on the buttons on the HTML page and play the different songs that the robot knows.
          This was where my development ended at this time.

          <h3>Challenges:</h3>
          <pre>
            One of the largest challenges was getting the initial motor running. While I knew how to code the
            motor correctly and how to connect it to the motor shield, I had to do some trial and error to
            figure out how to attach the pin correctly. The numbers used in the attach function do not
            correspond to the GPIO numbers on the motor shield. Therefore, figuring out how to activate the
            pin was a significant challenge, as there is a significant lack of documentation in this area.
            Another challenge was the physical size of the motor. Since the “drums” I used were
            significantly larger than the servo, the servo would move after every strike. Using a tape
            loop, I attached the servo to a cardboard base. The loop would still allow the motor to move
            on the strike, but would pull it back into position afterwards. This provided the needed
            stability to the robot.
          </pre>
          <h3>Further Design:</h3>
          <pre>
            This version of MusicBot is simple. Many additions can be made to improve its functionality.

            In terms of hardware, perhaps another servo can be added that would rotate the “drums.” This would
            reduce the limitation of 2 pitches. With several pitches, more complex patterns and songs can be
            played. Also, perhaps the speed of the “drumstick” can be adjusted in order to adjust the volume
            of each strike. This would add further variety to the music.

            On the software side, being able to program your own song would be an intersting area of
            development. This would perhaps require some use of dynamic memory, to allocate song arrays of
            different sizes and patterns. Currently, to make the robot learn a new song, the request handling
            if-else ladder has to be expanded. If there was a dynamic way to add in arrays, then new songs
            could be made on the fly.

            These are areas of further development, and can turn MusicBot into a fully functioning drum machine.
