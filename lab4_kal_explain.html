				An Extended Kalman Filter estimates the state using a two step process. The first step 
				is the actual prediction. The second step is an update of the parameters. In the first 
				step, the filter takes in the previous state and the control signal. These are plugged 
				into a function which gives the predicted state:

					Formula 1: x_t = f(x_t-1, u_t)
	
				In this formula, x_t is the state representation, t is the current time instant and u 
				is the control signal. The output of this formula is the predicted state of where the 
				robot should be. The next calculation is the prediction error matrix:

					Formula 2: P_t = F_t * P_t-1 * F_t’ + Q

				In this formula, P_t is the prediction error matrix. F_t is the Jacobian of function f 
				from Formula 1. Ordinarily, the entire probability density function of F would be 
				needed to calculate the PDF. However, we can plug in the current state measurement, as 
				done in Formula 1, and calculate the Jacobian at each step. F_t’ is the inverse of 
				F_t. Q is the process noise. It is a covariance matrix, with a row and column for each 
				variable in the state representation x. In our representation, the state variables are 
				independent, leading Q to be a diagonal matrix, with the variance due to process noise 
				on the diagonal. 

				The next step in for the filter is updating its predictions. Here another function is 
				required:

					Formula 3: z_t = h(x_t-1, y_t)

				Here z_t is the observed state. It is calculated through function h, which takes in 
				the previous state and the sensor readings, and predicts the state of the robot. Now 
				the update can begin. First the gain of the filter is calculated:

					Formula 4: K_t = P_t *  H_t’ * ( H_t * P_t * H_t’ + R) ^ -1

				Here K_t is the gain at the current time instant. H_t is the Jacobian of function h in 
				Formula 3. It is calculated much in the same way as F in Formula 2. H_t’ is the 
				inverse of H_t. P_t is taken from Formula 2. R is covariance noise matrix similar to 
				Q. However, this is the noise based on the sensors used. If the sensors are 
				independent from each other, then R is a diagonal matrix, with the variance of each 
				sensor reading on the diagonal. The gain is now used to calculate the state estimate. 

					Formula 5: X_t = x_t - K_t * (z_t - h(x_t, y_t))

				X_t is the state estimate and is the output of the filter. When the filter is used 
				again, it is sent as x_t in the next iteration. The x_t in the formula above is taken 
				from Formula 1. K_t and z_t are taken from Formulas 3 and 4 respectively.  The last 
				step is updating the prediction error matrix:

					Formula 6: P_t+1 = (I - K_t * H_t) * P_t

				The prediction error matrix is updated to be used on the next iteration. I is the 
				identity matrix, and K_t and H_t are the same as described above. P_t is the 
				prediction error matrix of the current iteration. Using this process, the Extended 
				Kalman filter is able to estimate the state, despite noise in the system.
